Dhruv and I submitted EcoGo for the SDHacks2022 Competition. We won 1st place in our category.

**What is EcoGo?**

EcoGo is the nature's best friend. Our product aims to reduce pollution, decrease carbon emission, and make the world a healthier and happier place by gamifying sustainability. EcoGo tracks an individual's Eco-Score to provide the most accurate information on one's contribution to making the Earth more sustainable. We make the process of helping the Earth an interactive, plus-plus game. The theory behind this idea is that through competition people will be incentivized to help the Earth. We recognize that every human has potential to help sustain the Earth. If even one person joins, that is an accomplishment because one-by-one we can soon involve all 7 billion people living on this Earth. EcoGo keeps a score of the user's contributions to the environment in order to gamify environmental contribution, and allows users to organize cleanups and community volunteering efforts to help contribute to the environment. Group volunteering helps foster a sense of community, and our points system along with our daily missions encourages the user to adopt more sustainable habits in the form of a game.
